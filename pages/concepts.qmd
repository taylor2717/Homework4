1. If your working directory is `myfolder/homework/`, what relative path would you specify to get the file located at `myfolder/MyData.csv`?

> `../MyData.csv`

2. What are the major benefits of using R projects?

> - Since there are often multiple files associated with analyses, it can make it difficult to keep analyses separate. R projects alleviates this.  
> - It provides a way to divide work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, work space, history, and folder structure/source documents.

3. What is git and what is github?

> **Git** is a version control software. 
> **GitHub** is an online hosting service for Git-based projects.

4. What are the two main differences between a tibble and a data.frame?

> - The two main differences are how they handle printing and data handling/behavior.
> - When you print a data frame, it displays all rows and columns. While a tibble shows only the first 10 rows and the columns that fit on the screen.
> - Also, Data frames automatically convert character strings to factors. However, tibbles do not do this; they preserve the original input data type.

5. Rewrite the following nested function call using Base Râ€™s chaining operator:  
`arrange(filter(select(as_tibble(iris), starts_with("Petal"), Species), Petal.Length < 1.55), Species)`

> ```r
> library(dplyr)
> library(tibble)
> 
> as_tibble(iris) |>
>   select(starts_with("Petal"), Species) |>
>   filter(Petal.Length < 1.55) |>
>   arrange(Species)
> ```
